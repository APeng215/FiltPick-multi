This is a fabric mod for Minecraft which enables you to pick up items selectively.
It's a lightweight mod and has a user-friendly interface.
If you need forge port, please click [here](https://github.com/APeng215/FiltPick-forge).

## How to Install

1. [Download](https://modrinth.com/mod/filtpick/versions) the Jar File of proper version.
2. Copy or cut the jar file you've just downloaded to your mod path (usually ".../.minecraft/mods" or ".../.minecraft/versions/\<versionName>/mods")
3. Make sure you have installed fabric api for proper version.

## How to use

Actually, the UI is too straightforward to require any guidance. It's recommended to try yourself __directly in game__.
- Put the item into the list, the function will take effect automatically.
- Whitelist-mode: Only the items below will be picked up
- Blacklist-mode: The items below won't be picked up
